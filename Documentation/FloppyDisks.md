# Floppy disks

The floppy disks can be used for permanent file storage.

The computer must have a floppy disk drive installed before floppy disks can be used. Currently (v0.4) only internal floppy disk drive is available, so you must place one inside the computer. Like any other computer part, you can only place the disk drive after motherboard has been placed.

Once the disk drive is installed, and the computer has been booted up, you will see the disk drives under the "Peripherals" section of the computer user interface. From there you can either insert a disk from your inventory, or eject a disk to your inventory.
