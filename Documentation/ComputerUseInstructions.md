# Computer use instructions

The computer requires power, so make sure you have it available.

After placing down the computer, put a motherboard into its inventory.

Only one motherboard can be put, so if you have a stack, separate one, or use ctrl+t to transfer only one. Same system applies to all computer parts.

After you have motherboard, you can add a CPU and memory modules.

A working computer requires:
* Power (electricity)
* A motherboard
* CPU
* Memory module(s)

After the computer is setup, turn it on. If you change parts when the computer is on, it shuts down automatically, and must be re-started.

Now you can access the computers console, which is currently a command line interface.
Built-in commands:
* as - assembler, generates object file from assembly source code
* cat - prints a text file on screen
* dmesg - prints the system log on screen
* edit - edit a text file (opens a new window for editing)
* ld - linker, links object file to an executable file
* objdump - prints the contents of binary files (object and executable)
* od - prints the contents of files as bytes
* scan - scans a document using a scanner and saves it to a file

If you have a scanner, place it near the computer, and the computer will automatically discover it when it starts up. If you place the scanner after the computer is already running, you need to restart the computer.

The computer does not currently have hard drives or disks, so every file you have will be lost when you turn off the computer (or the game is restarted).
